                <p>Each Friday studios has a different theme. You may join any studio that fits your schedule and has space. This is probably a good place to mention that a <b>few ideas are extremely common year-after-year</b>: coordinating lunch, finding parking, connecting with a study buddy, and splitting a bill with friends. <b>Consider these topics taboo</b>. While there are strong apps in each of these domains, treating these as taboo stretches your brain more.

Can you think of ways to enhance the feedback given to users using sound - what are some scenarios where this kind of auditory response would make an experience richer and more effective?</p>

                        <p>It’s a big data era now. Increased amounts of data created by internet activity and an expanding number of sensors in the environment often overwhelm us. There has been an explosion of people and organizations looking to do interesting things with their data. Data visualization describes any effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. It allows us to spot patterns, trends, and correlations that otherwise might go unnoticed in traditional reports, tables, or spreadsheets. Effective visualization is crucial for making insights and taking actions. In this studio, we’ll explore how to effectively present information to help people. Something you might consider to help you brainstorm:

But turning data about ourselves and our communities into valuable insights is still remarkably difficult.

                        <ul>
                            <li>How might we help people learn more about their everyday lives through self-tracking?</li>
                            <li>How might we help people draw insights from the mass of data they collect about themselves?</li>

                        <p> When the environments we occupy become a part of our routine, we fail to notice the ways in which we can perceive human behavior within them differently. This is an immense missed opportunity. In this studio, we will rethink interactions that occur between users and their spatial environments.These interactions can either be social or personal (thoughts/memories). We will then develop ways to perceive those environmental interactions in ways beyond what is familiar to us.</p>
                        <p>Some questions to think about:</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence is not new. <a href="https://www.forrester.com/webinar/Artificial+Intelligence+Whats+Possible+Today/-/E-WEB22545">A survey in late 2016</a> shows that 58% of technology professionals are researching AI, but only 12% of them are using AI for production. This is partially because AI technology is hard, which required time commitment and a special skill set. However, APIs and tools powered by the big names in tech such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM are competing to become the Visual Basic of AI, promising point-and-click development of intelligent applications to relatively unsophisticated developers. In this studio, we will utilize existing AI tools to solve design challenges around us. Questions to consider:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What design challenges we faced daily can be solved based on fundamental artificial intelligence?</li>
                                <li>How artificial intelligence inspires design?</li>
                                <li>Can we better human-computer/human machine interaction by combining different fundamentals of artificial intelligence?</li>

                        <h5>Studio leader: Toma Zubatiy</h5>
                        <h5>CSB 180, Friday 11:30am - 12:40pm</h5>
                        <p>It may be easier to understand mindfulness by considering what happens when we are not mindful: inattention. During inattention, our minds are free from the pressuring tasks of discerning stimuli or interpreting new information, and instead our brains return to what is known as the Default Mode Network (DMN), a sort of default circuit that activates when we are passive, associated with daydreaming, reliving the past or absentmindedly ruminating. Mindfulness is the quality or state of being aware of something. Our human ability to be aware of our thoughts, our environment and ourselves is very powerful, and being taken advantage of by the over-stimulating world we live in. In this studio we will attempt to create interfaces that can help us cultivate mindfulness to improve our lives.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Becoming more aware of ourselves by being mindful of our habits, choices and biometrics may allow us to make better and smarter decisions in the future.</li>
                          <li>Inattention is metabolically expensive, and over activity in DMN often manifests as anxiety. Mindful practice has been repeated cited for reducing DMN activity over time in practitioners.How can we overcome inattention? (<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/your-brain-can-only-take-so-much-focus">https://hbr.org/2017/05/your-brain-can-only-take-so-much-focus</a>)</li>
                          <li>Heart rate over time may be an example of a biometric that can be tracked to look at physiological effects of mindfulness training.</li>
                          <li>By becoming more aware of where our minds wander and why, we can help ourselves waste less energy and have more productive lives.</li>

                        <p> When we think of ability level, we often think of dis-ability and the things people can’t do. This studio will encourage students instead to think of designing technology to leverage what a person can do. As Jake Wobbrock at UW says, Ability-based design is the concept that users should not have to adapt their abilities to technology. Technology should adapt to the abilities of the users. A person’s ability level can change from one moment to the next (i.e., when you get a phone call but can’t answer your phone because your hands are full), but technology design has typically been inflexible to adapt to these changes in ability. In this studio, we will cover the principles of ability-based design, and students are challenged to look outside their own circle to find instances where ability is impaired by technology.

                        <h5>Studio leader: Ian Drosos</h5>

                        <p> Unnecessary obstacles limit learning in cognitively-complex domains such as computer programming. With a lack of appropriate feedback mechanisms and interventions, learners can experience frustration and disengage from the learning experience. In order to prevent learners from abandoning their learning goals, we must devise new ways to either remove or diminish the impact of the frustrating obstacles that learners encounter. For example, blocks-based programming languages remove the possibility of getting frustrating syntax errors, making them a good choice for teaching learners basic programming concepts. This studio is not limited to learning academic topics, like programming. Think about other topics in any preferred domain (aviation, cooking, gaming, etc.) that have frustrating obstacles that impede learning and consider:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How can we assist learners in their education of a specific topic?</li>
                                <li>How might we diminish/remove common obstacles that prevent learning a topic?</li>
                                <li>How has this domain not been made more accessible, but could be through technology?</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>For example, think about how a specific subset of people (children, seniors, people with disabilities, etc.) might have different learning obstacles that can be alleviated with your app.</li>
