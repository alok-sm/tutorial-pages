<ol>
    <li>Heuristic name is listed. Violations are ordered by heuristic.</li>
    <li>Evaluation applies all 10 heuristics across the two prototypes. Up to 3 of the heuristics can be used positively if no aspects of the prototypes violate those heuristics.</li>
    <li>Evaluation applies heuristics to partner's prototype in a useful, organized way.</li>
    <li>Violations listed each have an appropriate severity rating that will help teams prioritize their changes. The majority of the violations listed cannot correspond to the same heuristic. </li>
    <li>Feedback following each heuristic applied were specific, actionable, and easy to understand.</li>
		<li>Feedback draws a useful comparison between the two prototypes.</li>
    <li>Presents a bulleted list of at least 5 changes. </li>
    <li>Relationship between list of changes and feedback from the heuristic evaluations is clear.</li>
    <li>Video prototype submitted is about 1 minute long (not closer to 2 mins)</li>
    <li>Video prototype clearly demonstrates the goal of the app.</li>
    <li>Video prototype has narration or subtitles that clearly demonstrates different features that are meaningful to the overall goal.</li>
    <li>Video prototype shows who the potential users may be.</li>
