<h4>Team POV</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Presents team’s one-sentence point of view on a user need. Point-of-view should not offer a specific solution or violate a taboo.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Storyboard</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Storyboards illustrate three different ideas that engage the point of view and studio brief in different ways.</li>
    <li>Storyboards are drawn with a sharpie or thick marker to focus on high-level design.</li>
    <li>Storyboards’ sequences are easy to follow. Someone else could come up with a distinct prototype that would correspond with the point of view just from looking at the storyboard.</li>
    <li>Storyboard <strong>#1’s</strong> comprises at least 5 panels, begins with a clear user need, and ends with satisfaction addressing it.</li>
    <li>Storyboard <strong>#2’s</strong> comprises at least 5 panels, begins with a clear user need, and ends with satisfaction addressing it.</li>
    <li>Storyboard <strong>#3’s</strong> comprises at least 5 panels, begins with a clear user need, and ends with satisfaction addressing it.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#1</strong> presents an interface (at a sketch level) that accomplishes the design's major functionality.</li>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#1</strong> has enough detail that the user can see all of the interactions, understand how they work, and a programmer could use the prototype to create a functional application with a defined flow.</li>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#1</strong> connects to the point of view and a storyboard.</li>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#2</strong> presents an interface (at a sketch level) that accomplishes the design's major functionality.</li>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#2</strong> has enough detail that the user can see all of the interactions, understand how they work, and a programmer could use the prototype to create a functional application with a defined flow.</li>
    <li>Paper prototype <strong>#2</strong> connects to the point of view and a storyboard.</li>
    <li>Bring your team paper prototypes to studio.</li>
