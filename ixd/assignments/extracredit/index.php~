    IntroHCI assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something
        to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

						In this assignment, we use Google Analytics to run online A/B testing that you planned out in previous assignments. We statistically analyze our data. We interpret our results and use our interpretation to guide final changes to our prototypes. We reflect on the validity of our experiment. We settle on our prototype's branding, and finalize our aesthetics to reflect the essence of our design. We continue to update our dev plan, identifying new stretch goals that we might not have time for.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following rubric items are independently assessed. In general, evaluation works such that if the student/team meets, for instance, 9 out of 10 rubric items, then they have earned a grade of 90%. The assignment will not be graded unless it is submitted on a single, well-formatted, and easily readable PDF.
					</p>

						This assignment requires one submission per: <b>team</b> <!-- <b>individual</b> -->

							<font size="3">Compile and Analyze</font>
								<li>Submit screencaps of your Google Analytics page as evidence the experiment was conducted with <b>at least</b> 20 users</li>
								<li>Write a few detailed sentences explaining your recruitment process, justifying a good faith effort in obtaining your target demographic</li>
								<li>Present your data in a clear way, tables of both your observed and expected values are best, identifying the assignment of users to conditions and the results of user behavior in each condition</li>
								<li>Show the inputs to your chi-squared or other statistical test, your calculations, the resulting chi-squared value or test statistic, and resultant p value -- <a href="https://youtu.be/w31VWtllBqE">see another video for help</a></li>
								<li>Summarize all formal and informal, quantitative or qualitative, feedback you received from online testing</li>
							<br><font size="3">Interpret and Implement</font>
								<li>Write a few detailed sentences interpreting the results of your analysis, speculating why the results are as they are</li>
								<li>Write a few detailed sentences describing the internal and external validity of the experiment</li>
								<li>Write a short paragraph delineating changes you have made, will make, or would like to make to your prototype, and mark them as such, and justify these changes based on your results (it is very rare for a test not to suggest changes)</li>
								<li>Write a few detailed sentences discussing what you learned from A/B testing and any other data generated from using Google Analytics</li>
								<li>Implement feasible changes you identified as a result of testing</li>
								<li>Prototype is bug free and completely functional, polished as a result of online testing</li>
                <li>Accomplishing a goal in the app does not require unnecessary steps or processes</li>
							<br><font size="3">Branding and Aesthetics</font>
								<li>Clearly identify your prototype's final brand name and point of view to be used during your final pitch</li>
								<li>Prototype's final brand name reflects its functionality and final point of view</li>

								<li>Prototype is visually compelling</li>
								<li>Prototype's visual design is consistent within and across pages</li>
								<li>Prototype has a clean look; words/buttons are not cluttered and information is not presented in such large chunks that they can be overwhelming to a user</li>
								<li>Prototype is easy to read (i.e. no white text on light background or vice versa) on all pages</li>
							<br><font size="3">Development Plan</font>
								<li>Verify all tasks are actionable, prioritized, assigned an owner<span style="color:red;">*</span>, given a time estimate, and have actual time spent and completion date recorded</li>
								<li>In your comments column, identify tasks that were newly added or removed/updated, and those derived from A/B testing</li>
								<li>Add new stretch goals for your prototype and identify them in the comments column</li>
								<span style="color:red;">*every member of the team was assigned and completed at least one programming task</span><br>
							<br><font size="3">Submit</font>
								<li>Submit a clickable or easily typed link to your final prototype of the form “a9-projectname.herokuapp.com”. <b>If your prototype is changed before grading is completed, you will receive no credit for the assignment</b></li>
								<li>Submit a clickable or easily typed link to your A design prototype of the form “a9-projectname.herokuapp.com/path/to/page_A” and B design prototype of the form “a9-projectname.herokuapp.com/path/to/page_B”</li>
								<li>Submit a clickable or easily typed link to your project repository on GitHub. Make sure the grader has access by the deadline</li>
								<li>Submit a clickable or easily typable link to -- or a readable, properly oriented, and complete snapshot of -- your dev plan. Make sure the grader has access</li>
								<li>Make <tt>ixd@ucsd.edu</tt> a collaborator on Heroku so that we have access to your deployment history</li>
